# BalancingBot
This project is a computer science 630 final. Its goal was to teach a 'turtlebot'(the name of the robot) to balance an inverted pendulum using q-learning. <br>
The inputs to the model were the current and the previous angle. The output was a speed in between -1.5m/s and 1.5m/s. It would get a live reward.<br>
On running a simulation, it succeeded quickly. The OpenAI videos of its training are under the 'cartpole-experiment-1' folder.<br>
In order to get the angle, we used a vex potentiometer attached to an arduino attached to our ubuntu mini-computer(on the turtlebot.)<br>
For more information, the jupyter notebook contains more comprehensize coverage of the code and process.
